### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Part 1 of Lab 5 was my one of my favorites because I got to write a code that I felt was very practical and useful. By the end of Part 2, my code successfully converted a measurement of volume from milliliters in the metric system, to teaspoons, tablespoons, ounces, or cups. This experience in completing Part 1 of Lab 5 taught me valuable skills in writing practical and useful code to perform complex conversions between different units of measurement.

* Lab 6

    In Part 2 of Lab 6 I got to write a program that calculates the average of numbers given as command-line arguments. This was one of my favorite labs because I got to write a program that stored values in a double or float variable, use floating point arithmetic to compute the average, and properly handle values that are negative or zero. This experience allowed me to improve my programming knowledge and learn more about working with numeric values in a program.

* Lab 7

    My favorite part of Lab 7 was Part 2, where I improved a previously written Blackjack program by implementing functions. Using loops, I was able to handle hands with any number of cards. By the end of Part 2, my code successfully validated the number and contents of the arguments, calculated the total score of the blackjack hand, and printed the result to a standard output.
